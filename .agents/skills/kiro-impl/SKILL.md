# kiro-impl Skill

<background_information>
You operate with two layers of mode:

**Invocation** (from arguments):
- **Autonomous** (no task numbers): Run all pending tasks under the selected execution mode below
- **Manual** (task numbers provided): Execute selected tasks in the main context (`direct`-leaning; see Execution Mode Selection)

**Execution mode** (from `complexity_tier` / task-count / user override — see Step 2):
- **`direct`**: Parent (or a single agent) implements sequentially; reviewer once at selection/feature end — do not spawn per-task implementer×reviewer pairs
- **`wave`**: Default for tier M — dependency/boundary Wave batches, sticky on happy path, two-tier review per batch; `(P)` may run ready Waves concurrently
- **`strict`**: Tier L / user-forced — same as `wave`, plus smaller Integration/Validation batches and more aggressive splits; failure-path fresh agents stay mandatory

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All tests written before implementation code
  - Code passes all tests with no regressions
  - Tasks marked as completed in tasks.md only after batch/selection `kiro-verify-completion` returns `VERIFIED`
  - Implementation aligns with design and requirements
  - Independent reviewer approves each batch (or selection/feature end under `direct`) before the completion gate
  - Feature success reported only after Step 4 `FEATURE_GO` verification
  - Terminal `/kiro-validate-impl` + `FEATURE_GO` remain for all execution modes (including `direct` / tier S)

<instructions>

## Step 1: Gather Context

If steering/spec context is already available from conversation, skip redundant file reads.
Otherwise, load all necessary context:
- `docs/specs/{feature}/spec.json`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`
- Core steering context: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Additional steering files only when directly relevant to the selected task's boundary, runtime prerequisites, integrations, domain rules, security/performance constraints, or team conventions that affect implementation or validation
- Relevant local agent skills or playbooks only when they clearly match the task's host environment or use case; read the specific artifact(s) you need, not entire directories

### Parallel Research

The following research areas are independent and can be executed in parallel:
1. **Spec context loading**: spec.json, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md
2. **Steering, playbooks, & patterns**: Core steering, task-relevant extra steering, matching local agent skills/playbooks, and existing code patterns

After all parallel research completes, synthesize implementation brief before starting.

### Preflight

**Validate approvals**:
- Verify tasks are approved in spec.json (stop if not, see Safety & Fallback)

**Discover validation commands**:
- Inspect repository-local sources of truth in this order: project scripts/manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, app manifests), task runners (`Makefile`, `justfile`), CI/workflow files, existing e2e/integration configs, then `README*`
- Derive a canonical validation set for this repo: `TEST_COMMANDS`, `BUILD_COMMANDS`, and `SMOKE_COMMANDS`
- Prefer commands already used by repo automation over ad hoc shell pipelines
- For `SMOKE_COMMANDS`, choose the lightest trustworthy runtime-liveness check for the app shape (for example: root URL load, Electron launch, CLI `--help`, service health endpoint, mobile simulator/e2e harness if one already exists)
- Keep the full command set in the parent context, and pass only the task-relevant subset to implementer and reviewer sub-agents

**Establish repo baseline**:
- Run `git status --porcelain` and note any pre-existing uncommitted changes

## Step 2: Select Tasks & Determine Mode

**Parse arguments**:
- Extract feature name from `$1`
- If task numbers provided in `$2` (e.g., "1.1" or "1,2,3"): **manual invocation** (`direct`-leaning)
- If no task numbers: **autonomous invocation** (all pending tasks; execution mode from selection below)

**Build task queue**:
- Read tasks.md, identify actionable sub-tasks (X.Y numbering like 1.1, 2.3)
- Major tasks (1., 2.) are grouping headers, not execution units
- Skip tasks with `_Blocked:_` annotation
- For each selected task, check `_Depends:_` annotations -- verify referenced tasks are `[x]`
- If prerequisites incomplete, execute them first or warn the user
- Use `_Boundary:_` annotations to understand the task's component scope
- Count **executable sub-tasks** in the queue (incomplete `X.Y` that are not `_Blocked:_` and whose `_Depends:_` are satisfied or will be run in this invocation) — used for mode fallback

### Execution Mode Selection

Do **not** reinvent tier scoring. Prefer `spec.json` `complexity_tier` written by `kiro-orchestrate` (`rules/complexity-tier.md`). Key name: **`complexity_tier`** (`"S"` | `"M"` | `"L"`).

**Default selection** (first match wins after overrides):

1. **User override** (highest priority): explicit requests → force that execution mode; do not recompute from tier.
   - 「strict で」/ `strict` / `full` → **`strict`**
   - 「全部サブエージェントで」/ `wave` / 「wave で」 → **`wave`** (unless they also said strict)
   - 「direct で」/ `direct` / 「親だけで」 → **`direct`**
2. **Manual invocation** (task numbers in `$2`) → **`direct`** (main-context sequential; same as Manual Mode below).
3. Read `docs/specs/{feature}/spec.json` → `complexity_tier`:
   - `"S"` → **`direct`**
   - `"M"` → **`wave`**
   - `"L"` → **`strict`**
4. **Missing `complexity_tier`**: estimate from executable sub-task count in the queue (this is **impl execution mode only** — distinct from orchestration treating missing tier as flow-path **L**; see `kiro-orchestrate/rules/complexity-tier.md` § Scope note):
   - ≤ 3 → **`direct`**
   - ≤ 12 → **`wave`**
   - \> 12 → **`strict`**

**Do not break existing short-circuits**: Path B direct implementation (no `/kiro-impl`) stays outside this skill. Quality gates are **not** dropped for tier S / `direct` — selection/feature-end review + Step 4 terminal validate remain.

**Report** (exactly one line at run start, before first implementer dispatch):
`Execution mode: <direct|wave|strict> (reason: <tier S|M|L | task-count=N | manual | user override>)`

### Mode behavior summary

| Mode | When (default) | Behavior |
|------|----------------|----------|
| `direct` | tier **S**, or executable sub-tasks ≤ 3, or manual invocation | Parent (or single agent) implements sequentially. No per-task fresh implementer×reviewer pairs. Reviewer **once** at selection end (manual) or after all pending tasks / feature end (autonomous `direct`). Then deferred `kiro-verify-completion` + Step 4 validate. |
| `wave` | tier **M**, or missing-tier with 4–12 tasks | Full Wave batch dispatch (01–06): sticky happy path, parent mechanical + judgment reviewer per batch, `(P)` parallel when contract holds. |
| `strict` | tier **L**, or missing-tier with \> 12 tasks, or user「strict」 | Same as `wave`, plus: Integration / Validation stay solo and prefer **smaller** batches (size cap **2** for non-solo batches); split earlier when change-set or Spec Excerpts budget is tight. Failure-path **fresh** debugger / post-debug implementer stays mandatory (unchanged). Terminal validate unchanged. |

## Step 3: Execute Implementation

If execution mode is **`direct`**, use **Manual Mode** below (even when invocation was autonomous — treat the full pending queue as the selection). If **`wave`** or **`strict`**, use **Autonomous Mode** with the batch-definition deltas noted under `strict`.

### Autonomous Mode (sub-agent dispatch — `wave` / `strict`)

**Batch definition rules** (parent builds the next batch from `tasks.md`):

1. Consider only incomplete executable sub-tasks (`X.Y`, or an executable major when applicable).
2. Skip tasks with `_Blocked:_`.
3. Do not include tasks whose `_Depends:_` are unsatisfied.
4. **`_Wave:_` is highest priority**: When executable tasks have `_Wave: N_` annotations, form the next batch from the lowest incomplete Wave number whose dependencies are satisfied. Tasks that share the same Wave number are the batch candidates — do not mix different Wave numbers in one batch. Within a Wave, still apply the size cap and do not force `(P)` tasks with different `_Boundary:_` into the same batch (split into sequential batches of the same Wave if needed).
5. **Legacy heuristics only when `_Wave:_` is absent**: If `tasks.md` has no `_Wave:_` annotations (legacy plans), assemble batches with the rules below — do not invent Wave numbers at runtime.
6. A task may join the same heuristic batch only when **all** of the following hold:
   - `_Boundary:_` values are the same, or explicitly empty and clearly the same module
   - Dependencies close within the batch or already-completed tasks
   - Intentional Integration / Validation tasks may cross boundaries but must be a **solo batch** (do not mix with other tasks)
7. Batch size cap: **at most 4** executable sub-tasks under `wave` (**at most 2** under `strict`); split earlier if the estimated change set is too large. README / pure-documentation-only tasks may be included in an adjacent implementation batch. Under `strict`, Integration / Validation remain **solo** batches and non-solo batches should split earlier when Spec Excerpts approach the line budget.
8. Do **not** force `(P)` tasks with different boundaries into the same batch.

**`(P)` execution contract** (policy: promote markers to conditional parallel dispatch — not informational):

`(P)` means the parent **may** dispatch that task's batch/Wave in parallel with other ready `(P)` batches when **all** of the following hold:
- **Different `_Boundary:_`** values (non-overlapping component scopes)
- **Closed dependencies**: no shared incomplete `_Depends:_` between the candidate batches (each batch's Depends are already `[x]` or closed within that batch)
- **Non-overlapping change paths**: planned paths inferred from File Structure / `_Boundary:_` / task bodies do not overlap

**Parallel dispatch**: When multiple incomplete Waves are dependency-ready, marked `(P)`, and pass the conditions above, the parent may dispatch those batches **concurrently** (one implementer per batch). If any condition fails or collision risk is unclear → fall back to **serial** (lowest ready Wave first). Never unconditional parallel that ignores path/Depends conflicts.

**Merge / commit under parallel**: Parent still owns commits. Prefer selective staging per completed batch, committing in Wave-number order or completion order. On git conflict or overlapping staged paths → **stop and escalate to human**; do not force-merge or `git add -A`.

**Iteration discipline**: Default is ONE batch per iteration (form batch → one implementer → parent mechanical checks → (pass) one batch reviewer → commit → re-read tasks.md → next batch). When the `(P)` execution contract allows parallel Waves, one iteration may run multiple such batch cycles concurrently; each batch still gets its own implementer → mechanical → reviewer → selective commit. After any parallel set finishes (or aborts on conflict), re-read `tasks.md` before forming the next set.

**Context management** (parent vs implementer — keep these distinct):
- **Parent controller**: At the start of each iteration, re-read `tasks.md` and determine the next batch (or parallel-ready `(P)` batch set) as ordered task-ID list(s). Do NOT rely on accumulated memory of previous iterations for batch selection. After completing each iteration, the parent may discard verbose status/reviewer reports and retain only a one-line summary per batch (e.g., "batch [1.1, 1.2]: APPROVED, 5 files changed").
- **Sticky implementer**: On the success path, the implementer may retain batch-to-batch implementation knowledge **within that batch lineage**. Parent discarding verbose reports does **not** require discarding sticky implementer context, and does **not** require an unconditional fresh implementer each batch. Concurrent `(P)` batches use separate implementer lineages.

### Agent continuity (sticky vs fresh)

| Situation | Agent | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Batch success continuation (previous APPROVED → next batch) | **sticky**: resume the same implementer, OR parent re-dispatches with previous-batch one-line summary + Implementation Notes + next-batch excerpt only | Reduce cold start on happy path |
| In-batch REMEDIATION (reviewer REJECTED rounds 1–2) | Prefer **same implementer** with feedback re-sent (fresh not required) | Keep fix context |
| BLOCKED / unresolved NEEDS_CONTEXT / REJECTED → debug | **Always fresh** debugger | Cut pollution (unchanged) |
| RETRY after debug | **Always fresh** implementer (unchanged) | Cut pollution |
| Reviewer | Independent per batch (judgment-only after parent mechanical). Sticky not required | Independence |

**Sticky fallback** (hosts that cannot resume / continue the same agent): parent must still pass a **pseudo-sticky** payload — never a bare empty fresh start when continuing after APPROVED:
- File paths changed in the previous batch
- Related rows from `## Implementation Notes`
- Next batch task texts and `_Boundary:_` scope
- Spec excerpts for the next batch (see Pre-dispatch Spec Excerpts below)

### Pre-dispatch Spec Excerpts (parent, before each batch dispatch)

Do **not** rely on subagents reading `requirements.md` / `design.md` in full. Keep those files as single sources of truth in the repo; the parent cuts batch-needed fragments and embeds them in the prompt.

Before each implementer / reviewer / debugger dispatch for a batch, the parent:

1. Aggregate `_Requirements:` IDs from every task in the batch.
2. From `requirements.md`, extract only the referenced acceptance criteria (e.g., the cited conditions under requirement 3 among 1–7 — not the whole file).
3. From optional `_Design: D-Name_` annotations and/or `_Boundary:_` / task bodies, extract the matching design component section(s), plus the minimal cross-cutting slices needed for this batch (dependency-direction block, Error mapping for that boundary, File Structure lines for relevant paths). **Prefer stable anchors**: resolve `_Design:` or Boundary name to `{#D-...}` / `D-...` headings first (grep/search); if no hit, fall back to heading-text partial match; if still unresolved → treat as **NEEDS_CONTEXT**. Do **not** include Overview, Non-Goals, or unrelated component sections.
4. **Line-budget / split trigger**: if the combined excerpts would exceed roughly **150–250 lines**, revisit task boundaries and **split the batch** — do not paste full specs to stay under budget.
5. Embed excerpts in a fixed prompt section (authoritative for the batch):

```
## Spec Excerpts (authoritative for this batch)
### Requirements
<extracted acceptance criteria with source section numbers>
### Design
<extracted component + minimal cross-cutting slices with source section numbers>
```

**Authority**: Spec Excerpts are the authoritative input for implementer / reviewer / debugger. Spec file paths may be included as repository location only; do **not** instruct subagents to open and read those files as the primary workflow.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT re-excerpt**: If a subagent returns `NEEDS_CONTEXT` / `MISSING` naming a missing heading, the parent may extract that heading and re-dispatch **once** with additional excerpts (same one-shot re-dispatch rule). Do not tell the subagent to load the full file.

Do **not** introduce `design/` multi-file splits or inject steering wholesale — only short task-relevant steering snippets already allowed elsewhere.

If multi-agent capability is available, for each batch:

**a) Dispatch implementer** (one implementer per batch):
- Read `templates/implementer-prompt.md` from this skill's directory
- Run **Pre-dispatch Spec Excerpts** for this batch, then construct a prompt by combining the template with batch-specific context:
  - Ordered list of task IDs/descriptions and shared boundary scope
  - `## Spec Excerpts (authoritative for this batch)` with `### Requirements` and `### Design` (authoritative; not optional)
  - Spec file paths as repository location only (not a directive to read them in full)
  - Exact requirement and design section numbers each task in the batch must satisfy (using source numbering, NOT invented `REQ-*` aliases) — these must match what appears in the excerpts
  - Task-relevant steering context (short) and parent-discovered validation commands (tests/build/smoke as relevant)
  - Whether each task is behavioral or non-behavioral
  - Per task (or batch): `FEATURE_FLAG: required | skipped` — parent judges using the Feature Flag Protocol apply conditions below; if `tasks.md` or design excerpts require a flag → `required`
  - **Previous learnings**: Include any `## Implementation Notes` entries from tasks.md that are relevant to this batch's boundary or dependencies (e.g., "better-sqlite3 requires separate rebuild for Electron"). This prevents the same mistakes from recurring.
- The implementer builds Task Briefs from the **Spec Excerpts** (acceptance criteria, completion definition, design constraints, verification method) for the batch tasks, then implements them in order with TDD. Default: do **not** Read `requirements.md` / `design.md` in full.
- **Continuity**:
  - First batch of the run, or any dispatch after debug RETRY → spawn a **fresh** implementer
  - After a previous batch APPROVED → **sticky**: resume the same implementer when the host supports it; otherwise re-dispatch with the sticky-fallback payload above (pseudo-sticky). Do **not** require an unconditional empty fresh implementer on the success path

**b) Handle implementer status**:
- Parse implementer status only from the exact `## Status Report` block and `- STATUS:` field.
- If `STATUS` is missing, ambiguous, or replaced with prose, re-dispatch the implementer once requesting the exact structured status block only (prefer same implementer / sticky when available). Do NOT proceed to review without a parseable `READY_FOR_REVIEW | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT` value.
- **READY_FOR_REVIEW** → proceed to **parent mechanical checks** (step c), then reviewer only if those pass
- **BLOCKED** → dispatch debug subagent (see section below); do NOT immediately skip
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** → extract the named missing heading(s) from `MISSING`, append those excerpts once, and re-dispatch (prefer same implementer); if still unresolved → dispatch debug subagent

**c) Parent mechanical checks** (batch end, **before** reviewer dispatch):

After the implementer returns `READY_FOR_REVIEW`, the parent controller runs these checks itself and records `MECHANICAL_RESULTS`. Do **not** dispatch the reviewer until all pass.

1. **Regression**: Run the parent-held `TEST_COMMANDS` (task-relevant subset is allowed). Record each command, exit code, and a short pass/fail summary.
2. **TBD/TODO/FIXME**: Grep changed files for `TBD|TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX` (same intent as the reviewer template). Record CLEAN or match count / samples.
3. **Secrets**: Grep changed files for hardcoded secret patterns (e.g. `password=`, `api_key=`, `secret=`, `token=`, case-insensitive). Record CLEAN or match count / samples.
4. **Boundary**: Run `git diff --name-only` and compare against every `_Boundary:_` in the batch. Record WITHIN or files outside boundary.
5. **RED phase**: For behavioral tasks in the batch, confirm the implementer Status Report includes non-empty `RED_PHASE_OUTPUT` (required whether `FEATURE_FLAG` is `required` or `skipped`). Record VERIFIED | MISSING | N/A.

**If any mechanical check FAILs**:
- Do **not** call the reviewer.
- Treat as **REJECTED-equivalent remediation**: send the `MECHANICAL_RESULTS` (and concrete failures) back to the implementer (prefer same / sticky implementer).
- Count this remediations round toward the same **Bounded Review Rounds** limit as reviewer `REJECTED` (max 2 implementer re-dispatch rounds, then debug on the next failure).

**If all mechanical checks PASS** → proceed to step d with the recorded `MECHANICAL_RESULTS`.

**d) Dispatch reviewer** (one judgment review per batch):

- Call the reviewer **once for the whole batch** (not once per task).
- Read `templates/reviewer-prompt.md` from this skill's directory
- Construct a review prompt with:
  - Parent `MECHANICAL_RESULTS` (commands, exit codes, grep summaries) — the reviewer may **trust these as the mechanical baseline and must not re-run the full suite by default**; re-run only if results are missing or look suspicious
  - The batch task list (ordered IDs) and relevant spec section numbers
  - The same `## Spec Excerpts (authoritative for this batch)` used for the implementer (Requirements + Design); paths may appear as location only
  - The implementer's status report (for reference only — reviewer must verify judgment items independently)
  - Batch `_Boundary:_` scope and task-relevant validation command names (for context; mechanical execution already done by parent)
  - Per-task `FEATURE_FLAG: required | skipped` (when `skipped`, missing flag-only steps is not a REJECT reason; `RED_PHASE_OUTPUT` for behavioral tasks still required)
- The reviewer must apply the `kiro-review` protocol for **batch-local judgment review** (spec alignment, test quality, implementation reality), with mechanical checks satisfied via parent `MECHANICAL_RESULTS` unless re-run is warranted. Default: compare judgment against **Spec Excerpts**, not a full Read of `requirements.md` / `design.md`.
- The reviewer sub-agent runs `git diff` itself as the primary source of truth for judgment.
- Spawn a reviewer sub-agent with this prompt (independent per batch; sticky not required)

**e) Handle reviewer verdict**:
- Parse reviewer verdict only from the exact `## Review Verdict` block and `- VERDICT:` field.
- If `VERDICT` is missing, ambiguous, or replaced with prose, re-dispatch the reviewer once requesting the exact structured verdict only. Do NOT mark batch tasks complete, commit, or continue to the next batch without a parseable `APPROVED | REJECTED` value.
- **APPROVED** → proceed to **batch completion gate** (step e2). Do **not** call `kiro-verify-completion` on APPROVED alone, and do **not** mark any batch task `[x]` yet.
- **REJECTED (round 1-2)** → re-send review feedback to the **same** implementer when possible (sticky remediation; fresh not required); otherwise re-dispatch with feedback plus the sticky-fallback payload. After the implementer returns `READY_FOR_REVIEW` again, re-run **parent mechanical checks** before the next reviewer call. Do **not** require a full `kiro-verify-completion` on each remediation — parent mechanical re-run is enough until the batch completion gate.
- **REJECTED (round 3)** → dispatch debug subagent (see section below)

**e2) Batch completion gate** (once per batch, immediately before marking all tasks `[x]`):

Apply `kiro-verify-completion` **exactly once** for the whole batch (claim type: `BATCH` / multi-`TASK`). Do **not** call it per sub-task checkbox, and do **not** treat implementer or reviewer prose as sufficient evidence by itself.

Evidence for this gate:
- Parent `MECHANICAL_RESULTS` already recorded for this batch (test commands, exit codes, TBD/Secrets/Boundary/RED summaries)
- Reviewer `APPROVED` from the exact `## Review Verdict` block

**If `VERIFIED`** → mark **all** tasks in the batch `[x]` in tasks.md, then perform one selective git commit for the batch (step f).

**If `NOT_VERIFIED` or `MANUAL_VERIFY_REQUIRED`** → do **not** treat the batch as complete: do not mark any batch task `[x]`, do not commit as success, and either remediate (send gaps back to the implementer; counts toward Bounded Review Rounds) or BLOCK affected task(s) if the gate cannot be satisfied.

**f) Commit** (parent-only, selective staging; one commit per verified batch):
- Stage only the files actually changed for this batch, plus tasks.md
- **NEVER** use `git add -A` or `git add .`
- Use `git add <file1> <file2> ...` with explicit file paths
- Commit message format: `feat(<feature-name>): <batch summary spanning task IDs>`

**g) Record learnings**:
- If this batch revealed cross-cutting insights, append a one-line note to the `## Implementation Notes` section at the bottom of tasks.md

**h) Debug subagent** (triggered by BLOCKED, NEEDS_CONTEXT unresolved, mechanical FAIL after review-round budget exhausted, or REJECTED after 2 remediation rounds):

The debug subagent runs in a **fresh context** — it receives only the error information, not the failed implementation history. This avoids the context pollution that causes infinite retry loops.

- Read `templates/debugger-prompt.md` from this skill's directory
- Construct a debug prompt with:
  - The error description / blocker reason / reviewer rejection findings
  - `git diff` of the current uncommitted changes
  - The batch task descriptions and relevant spec section numbers
  - `## Spec Excerpts (authoritative for this batch)` (same batch excerpts; plus any one-shot additional excerpts if NEEDS_CONTEXT named missing headings)
  - Spec paths as repository location only; optional short extra context slices only when needed for the failure (still not full-file dumps)
- The debugger must apply the `kiro-debug` protocol to this failure investigation.
- Preserve rich failure context: error output, reviewer findings, current `git diff`, task/spec refs, and any relevant Implementation Notes.
- When available, the debugger should inspect runtime/config state and use web or official documentation research to validate root-cause hypotheses before proposing a fix plan.
- Spawn a fresh sub-agent with this prompt

**Handle debug report**:
- Parse `NEXT_ACTION` from the debug report's exact structured field.
- If `NEXT_ACTION: STOP_FOR_HUMAN` → append `_Blocked: <ROOT_CAUSE>_` to tasks.md, stop the feature run, and report that human review is required before continuing
- If `NEXT_ACTION: BLOCK_TASK` → append `_Blocked: <ROOT_CAUSE>_` to tasks.md, skip to next batch
- If `NEXT_ACTION: RETRY_TASK` → preserve the current worktree; do NOT reset or discard unrelated changes. Spawn a **new** (fresh) implementer sub-agent with the debug report's `FIX_PLAN`, `NOTES`, and the current `git diff`, and require it to repair the batch with explicit edits only
  - If the new implementer succeeds (READY_FOR_REVIEW → parent mechanical PASS → reviewer APPROVED) → normal flow
  - If the new implementer also fails → repeat debug cycle (max 2 debug rounds total). After 2 failed debug rounds → append `_Blocked: debug attempted twice, still failing — <ROOT_CAUSE>_` to tasks.md, skip
- **Max 2 debug rounds per batch**. Each round: fresh debug subagent → fresh implementer. If still failing after 2 rounds, the affected task(s) are blocked.
- Record debug findings in `## Implementation Notes` (this helps subsequent batches avoid the same issue)

**`(P)` markers**: See **`(P)` execution contract** under Batch definition rules. Do not force `(P)` tasks with different `_Boundary:_` values into the same batch. Hosts that cannot run concurrent sub-agents still honor the contract by processing ready `(P)` Waves **serially** (never inventing informational-only semantics).

**Fallback**: If multi-agent is not available, fall back to `direct` (Manual Mode) execution for all tasks.

### Manual Mode / `direct` (main context)

Used for **manual invocation**, execution mode **`direct`** (tier S or ≤3 tasks), and multi-agent fallback. Execute the selected / pending queue with the same TDD + mechanical + judgment loop. Do **not** dispatch a fresh implementer and reviewer per sub-task. `kiro-verify-completion` is **deferred** to selection completion — not required after every remediation, and not required merely because a task was `APPROVED`.

Reviewer cadence under `direct`: run judgment review **once** after all tasks in the selection/queue are implemented (or once if only one task) — not once per sub-task. Parent mechanical checks still run before that reviewer call.

**Spec scoping under `direct`**: The parent *is* the implementer, so there is no subagent prompt — but apply the **same excerpt discipline** as Pre-dispatch Spec Excerpts: for each task (or for the whole selection before coding), extract only the referenced `_Requirements:` criteria and matching design sections (prefer `{#D-...}` / `_Design:` / Boundary anchors). Keep the working brief roughly within the **150–250 line** budget; if larger, implement in smaller slices. Do **not** load entire `requirements.md` / `design.md` as the default. If a subagent reviewer is used at selection end, pass those excerpts as `## Spec Excerpts (authoritative for this batch)`.

For each selected task:

**1. Build Task Brief**:
Before writing any code, from the scoped excerpts (not full-file dumps) clarify:
- What observable behaviors must be true when done (acceptance criteria)
- What files/functions/tests must exist (completion definition)
- What technical decisions to follow from design excerpts (design constraints)
- How to confirm the task works (verification method)

**2. Execute TDD cycle** (Kent Beck's RED → GREEN → REFACTOR):
- **RED**: Write test for the next small piece of functionality based on the acceptance criteria. Test should fail.
- **GREEN**: Implement simplest solution to make test pass, following the design constraints.
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code structure, remove duplication. All tests must still pass.
- **VERIFY**: All tests pass (new and existing), no regressions. Confirm verification method passes.
- **Per-task mechanical (lightweight)**: Optionally re-run the task-relevant subset of `TEST_COMMANDS` after each task; remediate in-context on failure. Do **not** spawn a fresh implementer or reviewer per sub-task under `direct`.
- **Defer mark**: Do **not** mark `[x]` yet if more selected tasks remain; continue to the next selected task.

**2b. Selection / feature-end review** (once after all selected/queued tasks are implemented — not once per sub-task):
- Run the full **parent mechanical checks** (Regression / TBD / Secrets / Boundary / RED) across the selection's changes. If any FAIL, remediate in-context (count toward the review-round budget) and do not proceed to judgment.
- When mechanical checks PASS, apply `kiro-review` judgment review **once** for the whole selection: if the host supports fresh subagents, use a fresh reviewer with `MECHANICAL_RESULTS` and the selection's Spec Excerpts; otherwise perform judgment in the main context using the `kiro-review` protocol against the same scoped excerpts. Do NOT proceed to the completion gate until the verdict is parseably `APPROVED`. Do **not** call `kiro-verify-completion` here.
- Keep recorded `MECHANICAL_RESULTS` + `APPROVED` for the completion gate.

**3. Selection completion gate** (after selection/feature-end review is `APPROVED`):
- **One selected task**: apply `kiro-verify-completion` once at that task's end (claim type: `TASK`), then mark it `[x]`.
- **Multiple selected tasks**: apply `kiro-verify-completion` **once** for the whole selection (claim type: `BATCH` / multi-`TASK`) using parent mechanical evidence + reviewer `APPROVED` for those tasks; then mark all selected tasks `[x]`.
- **If `NOT_VERIFIED` or `MANUAL_VERIFY_REQUIRED`**: do not mark any remaining incomplete selected tasks `[x]`; remediate or stop with gaps.

## Step 4: Final Validation

**Autonomous invocation** (`wave`, `strict`, or autonomous `direct` completing the full pending queue):
- After all tasks complete, run `/kiro-validate-impl $1` as a GO/NO-GO gate — **required for every execution mode**, including tier S / `direct` (do not skip quality gates for S)
- If validation returns GO → before reporting feature success, apply `kiro-verify-completion` to the feature-level claim using the validation result and fresh supporting evidence
- If validation returns NO-GO:
  - Fix only concrete findings from the validation report
  - Cap remediation at 3 rounds; if still NO-GO, stop and report remaining findings
- If validation returns MANUAL_VERIFY_REQUIRED → stop and report the missing verification step

**Manual invocation** (task-number selection only):
- Suggest running `/kiro-validate-impl $1` but do not auto-execute

## Feature Flag Protocol

Feature Flag Protocol is **opt-in**. The parent passes `FEATURE_FLAG: required | skipped` per batch / task.

**Required** only when **all** of the following hold (or an explicitly documented equivalent):

- The change is **brownfield**: it alters behavior on an existing production / user-facing path
- Without a flag, an intermediate state would be exposed to users, **or** the design requires a flag as the rollback unit

If `tasks.md` or design excerpts require a flag → `required`.

**When `FEATURE_FLAG: required`**, enforce RED → GREEN with a feature flag:

1. **Add flag** (OFF by default): Introduce a toggle appropriate to the codebase (env var, config constant, boolean, conditional)
2. **RED -- flag OFF**: Write tests for the new behavior. Run tests → must FAIL. If tests pass with flag OFF, the tests are not testing the right thing. Rewrite.
3. **GREEN -- flag ON + implement**: Enable the flag, write implementation. Run tests → must PASS.
4. **Remove flag**: Make the code unconditional. Run tests → must still PASS.

**When `FEATURE_FLAG: skipped`**, use a standard RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle (no flag add/toggle/remove). Typical skip cases:

- greenfield (new package / new binary / unpublished feature)
- pure refactoring, configuration, or documentation
- internal module additions where design does not require a flag
- tasks with no behavioral change

**RED evidence**: For behavioral tasks, keep `RED_PHASE_OUTPUT` (failing tests before implementation) whether the flag is `required` or `skipped`. Do not REJECT solely for missing flag-only steps when `skipped`.

## Critical Constraints
- **Execution Mode Selection**: Choose `direct` / `wave` / `strict` per Step 2 (user override → manual → `complexity_tier` → task-count fallback). Report the chosen mode and reason in one line at run start. Tier S / `direct` must not default to per-task fresh implementer×reviewer.
- **Strict Handoff Parsing**: Never infer implementer `STATUS` or reviewer `VERDICT` from surrounding prose; only the exact structured fields count
- **Parent Spec Excerpts**: Before each batch dispatch, inject `## Spec Excerpts (authoritative for this batch)`; if combined excerpts exceed ~150–250 lines, split the batch. Under `direct`, apply the same excerpt discipline in-context (do not full-file dump). Do not make full-file Read of requirements/design the default for subagents. Do not split design into multi-file layouts under this skill.
- **`(P)` Execution Contract**: `(P)` authorizes conditional parallel Wave/batch dispatch when boundaries, Depends, and paths are disjoint; otherwise serial. Never treat `(P)` as informational-only. On merge conflict under parallel → stop for human. Applies to `wave` / `strict` only.
- **Sticky on Happy Path**: Under `wave` / `strict`, after APPROVED prefer sticky / resume (or pseudo-sticky fallback) for the next batch; do not treat unconditional fresh implementer as required on the success path. Under parallel Waves, sticky applies per-batch lineage, not across concurrent batches
- **Fresh on Failure / Debug**: Under `wave` / `strict` (including `strict` / tier L): debugger is always fresh; implementer after debug RETRY is always fresh; max 2 debug rounds unchanged
- **Deferred Verify-Completion**: Call `kiro-verify-completion` once per batch (or once per `direct`/manual selection) immediately before marking tasks `[x]`, plus once at feature end for `FEATURE_GO`. Do not require it after every APPROVED, every sub-task checkbox, or every remediation. Subagent self-reports are never sufficient evidence alone.
- **Terminal Validate Retained**: Autonomous completion always runs Step 4 `/kiro-validate-impl` + `FEATURE_GO` for `direct`, `wave`, and `strict` alike — never drop end gates for tier S
- **No Destructive Reset**: Never use `git checkout .`, `git reset --hard`, or similar destructive rollback inside the implementation loop
- **Selective Staging**: NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`; always stage explicit file paths
- **Bounded Review Rounds**: Max 2 implementer re-dispatch rounds per mechanical FAIL or reviewer REJECTED, then debug
- **Two-Tier Review**: Parent runs mechanical checks before reviewer; on mechanical FAIL skip reviewer and remediate; reviewer focuses on judgment using parent `MECHANICAL_RESULTS`
- **Bounded Debug**: Max 2 debug rounds per batch (debug + re-implementation per round); if still failing → BLOCKED
- **Bounded Remediation**: Cap final-validation remediation at 3 rounds

## Output Description

**Start of run**: One line — selected execution mode and reason (see Execution Mode Selection).

**`wave` / `strict`**: For each batch (including each batch in a parallel `(P)` set), report: task ID list, implementer status, parent mechanical summary, reviewer verdict, batch verify-completion status, files changed, commit hash. After all batches: final validation result and feature `FEATURE_GO` verification.

**`direct` / manual**: Tasks executed with test results; selection verify-completion status. Status of completed/remaining tasks. Autonomous `direct` also reports Step 4 validation + `FEATURE_GO`.

**Format**: Concise, in the language specified in spec.json.

## Safety & Fallback

### Error Scenarios

**Tasks Not Approved or Missing Spec Files**:
- **Stop Execution**: All spec files must exist and tasks must be approved
- **Suggested Action**: "Complete previous phases: `/kiro-spec-requirements`, `/kiro-spec-design`, `/kiro-spec-tasks`"

**Test Failures**:
- **Stop Implementation**: Fix failing tests before continuing
- **Action**: Debug and fix, then re-run

**All Tasks Blocked**:
- Stop and report all blocked tasks with reasons; human review needed

**Spec Conflicts with Reality**:
- Block the task with `_Blocked: <reason>_` -- do not silently work around it

**Upstream Ownership Detected**:
- If review, debug, or validation shows that the root cause belongs to an upstream, foundation, shared-platform, or dependency spec, do not patch around it inside the downstream feature
- Route the fix back to the owning upstream spec, keep the downstream task blocked until that contract is repaired, and re-run validation/smoke for dependent specs after the upstream fix lands

**Task Plan Invalidated During Implementation**:
- If debug returns `NEXT_ACTION: STOP_FOR_HUMAN` because of task ordering, boundary, or decomposition problems, stop and return for human review of `tasks.md` or the approved plan instead of forcing a code workaround

**Session Interrupted**:
- Safe to re-run `/kiro-impl $1` — completed tasks are already `[x]` in tasks.md and committed to git
- The controller re-reads tasks.md on each iteration, so it will pick up where it left off automatically
